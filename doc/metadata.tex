\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Short overview}

\paragraph{} Hey there, welcome to our Bowling Game project! We were hired specifically \textit{not} to build a new system, but to \textbf{fix} an original implementation by some other team in terms of its \textbf{maintainability}, and implement only a few new features into it. We have toiled hard to deliver a codebase which satisfies many important software design principles.
\paragraph{} We have also included all the three features, namely:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Maximum multiplayer up to six players
    \item Pause and play the game, and resume a paused game from memory
    \item View statistical information about the best and worst players
\end{itemize}

It was interesting to note that our refactoring was effective enough that implementing all these features required small changes to the code at obvious locations.

\subsection{Contributions}

Each of us worked for almost 40-45 hours on the codebase. We had these roles:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Gaurang: Complete backend refactor (splitting out Lane, reducing cyclomatic complexity, observer pattern)
    \item Animesh: Complete frontend refactor (the View Classes, and entirety of Widget)
    \item Avani: Building Documentation, miscellaneous fixes
\end{itemize}
